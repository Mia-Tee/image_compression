- In the context of image compression, the image quality options (20%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90%) refer to the level of compression applied to the original image when it's saved in a compressed format, typically a JPEG format.
- These percentages indicate how much image quality is retained during the compression process, with 100% representing the original image quality and lower percentages representing higher levels of compression (and thus lower quality).

Here's what those percentages mean:

## Image Quality Options Explained:
- 100% Quality: This is essentially no compression. The image will retain all of its original detail, but the file size will be large (close to the original).

- 90% Quality: The image will be compressed slightly, resulting in a file size reduction with minimal loss of quality. Most people wonâ€™t notice a visible difference.

- 80% Quality: The file size is reduced more, and the image will show a slight reduction in quality, but still remains very close to the original.

- 70% Quality: Compression becomes more noticeable, and there will be some visible artifacts, particularly in areas with lots of detail or color gradients. However, it still maintains good quality for most purposes.

- 60% Quality (default): This offers a balance between reduced file size and reasonably good image quality. Compression artifacts will be noticeable if you look closely, but the image will generally be acceptable for casual viewing or sharing online.

- 50% Quality: Compression artifacts become more noticeable. The image file size is smaller, but the loss of detail is visible, especially in high-contrast areas.

- 40% Quality and below: At this level, significant compression is applied, resulting in a much smaller file size but with a noticeable drop in image quality. The image may appear pixelated or blurry, especially in detailed or high-contrast areas.

- 20% Quality: Heavy compression is applied, leading to a very small file size but with a drastic reduction in image quality. The image may appear very pixelated or blurred, and artifacts will be obvious.

## How This Affects the Original Image:
- The original image itself remains unchanged unless you're overwriting it. When you apply compression, you're creating a new, compressed copy of the image.

- The lower the quality percentage, the smaller the file size but the more noticeable the degradation in the image quality.

- For formats like JPEG, compression is lossy, meaning some data is permanently removed to reduce the file size. Once compressed, you can't fully restore the original image quality by decompressing it.

## Practical Use:
- Higher Quality (80% - 90%): Suitable for images where you want to preserve quality, such as photos for printing or professional use.

- Mid-Range (60% - 70%): A good balance for general use, such as sharing images online or in presentations where file size matters but quality is still important.
- Lower Quality (40% and below): Useful for scenarios where file size is more important than quality, such as thumbnails, quick previews, or when bandwidth is limited.
